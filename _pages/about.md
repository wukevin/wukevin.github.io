I am a PhD student studying Computer Science at Stanford University. I am fortunate to be jointly advised by Dr. James Zou ([lab page](https://www.james-zou.com)) and Dr. Howard Chang ([lab page](http://changlab.stanford.edu)). My research interests lie in applying machine learning to biomedical datasets; specifically, I work on developing new machine learning approaches that are inspired by the biological considerations of a dataset, thus enabling more elegant, generalizable models.

Prior to starting my graduate studies in 2018, I completed my B.S. from UC Berkeley in 2016 and worked at [Illumina, Inc.](https://www.illumina.com) as a bioinformatics scientist for two years.
