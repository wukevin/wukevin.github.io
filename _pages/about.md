I am a PhD student studying Computer Science at Stanford University. I am fortunate to be jointly advised by Dr. James Zou ([lab page](https://sites.google.com/site/jamesyzou/home)) and Dr. Howard Chang ([lab page](http://changlab.stanford.edu)). My research interests lie in the intersection between cutting-edge genomics/transcriptomics and machine learning, particularly in the development of interpretable machine learning models that allow us to gain new biomedical insights. Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my B.S. from UC Berkeley and worked at [Illumina, Inc.](https://www.illumina.com) as a bioinformatics scientist.
