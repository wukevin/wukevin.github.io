Although novel deep learning methods like AlphaFold and OmegaFold excel at predicting the 3D structure of a protein given a sequence of amino acids, generating novel protein structures remains a tremendous challenge -- one that if solved, could lead to numerous breakthroughs in protein-based therapeutics. We present a generative model of protein structure; we combine recent advances in diffusion models with a clever representation of protein structure to acheive state-of-the-art generative results.
