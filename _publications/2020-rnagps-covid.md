SARS-CoV-2 represents a pressing global health crisis; gaining a deeper understanding of its biological mechanisms is key to developing novel therapeutics to mitigate its spread and impact. We find that our prior model for predicting RNA transcript subcellular localization behaviors can be used to make predictions describing how SARS-CoV-2's viral transcripts behave inside human cells. These predictions have been subsequently experimentally validated in [Flynn et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742100297X).
